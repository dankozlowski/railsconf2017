DHH

* "IS DHH going to intrpduce another something we have to turn off
  everything we use rail?"

* Went on for a while about how he got in to Ruby
* Most people using Rails didn't come to rails out of a rational deliberation of the available tools -- we went 
  because we heard it was good.

* It's easy with so much new tech to freak and and say 'we don't know what we're doing.  We'll never know what we're doing'.
* == FUD

What can helps us feel less scared?
* Railsconf: communcal experience where we can say "yay us"

Then he kinda of babbled on for a while about philosopgy. Someone get this guy a soapbox.
