# Is it food?  Intro to ML

We can identify photos of food through pattern recognition
* Interesting to automate because humans can recall info piecemeal and assemble it
* Much harder to do as a machine.

Types of kearning
* Unsupervised
  * clustering of information in to buckets, computer decides what it is.  What is this sample closest to?
* Supervised learning
  * Provide all information up front with definiteion, machine uses those examples to understand new stimuli
* Reinforncement
  * on each guess, we tell the computer if it's right.

Neural networks
* Started in 1967, nothing reallu usefu unt tensor flow

Tensor flow
* way of describing networks as a data flow graph
* takes in a tensor and returns an operated upon tesnor
* tensor == an n-dimenional array of information
* Inception == prebuilt graph useful for working with image net images

INtegration ML with Rails
* Tensorflow.rb -- couldn't get it running, Docker also didn't work

How did he get it working?
* Install python, create virtualenv, install tensor flow
* Python is the best tooling right now

Retraining: Transfer learning == if we look at dataflow graph from inception, we can replace last step with our own data.
* Collect a bunch of data, and decide on the categories.
* category selection is crucial: if you've only ever seen food, you've only see food.  Have other categories to comprare again
  * For example, we dont' want photos of people or text
  * 1-2k images for food
* Tensor flow only needs images 299px by 299px
* Retrained with existing TF script
  * Bottleneck file == informal term for the results of the previos TF layer.  Bult and cached for reuse
  * Data is split in to three parts: training, testing, valudation
  * cross-entroy = loss metric
* Tests are kept separate from training so that we don' just see things we've already processed.

Results:
* Graph == encoded thing from outcome of previous step
* Labels == category for final output (food, animal, text, etc)  Used to look up final value

Once retrained, we want to be able to label image.  Will return a alue for each category for likely match.
* you're never going to get 100% of gfood unless you have bad categories.  You don't want perfect accuracy.

Make it a web server
* Use flask to create a service in Python that Rails can hit

Lessons
* Know what you're trying to do, and use the correct tooling whhen learning (AKA Python)
