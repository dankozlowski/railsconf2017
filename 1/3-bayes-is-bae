# Bayes is Bae

"We have the power to predict the future.  The bad news is that we're really bad at it"

Thomas Bayes was born in 1701, statician and minister.  Produced paper on Bayes method that was published after his death.

Bayes: if we draw 100 tickets and 10 of them are winners, what does that say about the future possibility of drawin a
winner?  What if we have one sample?  We can take two probabiity distrocutions that are related, and even if our
preduction is wrong, it's better than no prediction at all.

AI
* Given bayes rule, we can use the prediction to determine where the robot is.
* Predict what we need to do to move robot
* what happens when our prediction of position and our measurement disagree?
* Convolute (comine) the two
* Kalman Filter!  We can see much better pathing for the chaser robot

Bayes Rule
* Coin test
* Produces same outcome as a logic tree
* Probability of getting the bad coin will never reach 0, bayes can't get there.

Kalman Filter
* This is easy to look up online
* A way to de-noise sensor readings to find better fit lines.
