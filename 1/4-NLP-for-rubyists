NLP can be used to create better UX.
Bad NLP: Computer, earl gray, hot.  Very explicit to what we're telling hte machine to do
Good NLP: Accessibilty (kids who can't read prefer to speak), moms holding a baby
Can help us understand very loarge bodies of data, like feedback forms.  And stop us form sending reall angry emails :P

Why is NLP hard?
* Human languages are horrible.  Super ambiguous, irregular verbs, idioms.
* No formal closed computation grammar.
* Humans are very inprecise (I'm starving, you look freezing)
* Computers suck at sarcasm (Sure, I'd _love_ to do the dishes)
* because humans use language in weird ways, and language is constantly evolving

Why is NLP hard?  Humans.

Turing: if the judge can't tell who is the machine and who is the human, the machine passes.
People in NLP usually don't make their own models -- tons of pretrained models exist
